There is just over one month to go before ACL 2020 (July 5-10)! We recently announced the list of [accepted papers](https://acl2020.org/program/accepted/) and wanted to start sharing some statistics around submissions, reviews and other interesting topics over the next month. In this blog post we focus on acceptance rates for ACL2020, comparison of rates with prior ACLs, track acceptance rates, and finally some statistics by country. We also encourage readers to read prior ACL statistics blogs, in particular the one for [ACL 2019](https://acl2019pcblog.fileli.unipi.it/?p=161).

## 1. General Statistics

ACL2020 had an acceptance rate of 22.7% based on 3,429 submissions and 779 accepted papers.  3,429 is a record number of submissions for ACL.  To put that number in perspective, and to show fast the field has grown, two years ago, the number of submissions was 1,544, or less than half.  Ten years ago, there were “only” 956 submissions.

Of the 779 accepted papers, 571 were long papers and 208 were short papers. Note that when Desk Rejects and Withdrawals are removed, 29 and 312 papers respectively, the acceptance rate is 25.2%.

## 2. Comparison with Prior ACLs

This year’s ACL is in line with acceptance rates with the most recent editions of the ACL.  ACL 2019 also had an acceptance rate of 22.7% with similar rates for long and short papers.  For a history of acceptance rates at the ACL, please visit the [ACL Wiki](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/Conference_acceptance_rates).

## 3. Track Statistics

Next, we break up the acceptance rate by track.  Machine Learning for NLP, Dialogue and Interactive Technologies, Machine Translation, Information Extraction and NLP Applications were the top five most popular tracks, with each having over 200 submissions.  Machine Learning for NLP had nearly 300 submissions (296). To show how much our field has grown, ACL 2002 received 258 submissions <i>total</i> across all tracks. 

{% include gallery id="submissions-per-track" %}

Acceptance rates for each track ranged from 17.9% to 41.7% as follows.

## 4. Country Statistics

We follow ACL 2019 in extracting the country listed in Softconf by the corresponding author and calculating statistics on that set.  There were 57 countries represented in this subset. We list the 25 countries with the most submissions below.  China had the most submissions with 1,084, followed closely by the United States. In ACL 2019, the United States had 820 submissions and China had 817.  Germany had the third most submissions with 136.

{% include gallery id="submissions-per-country" %}

Finally, we analyze the acceptance rates for each country based on contact author. The following table lists all 57 countries in alphabetical order. In the end, 37 countries have papers in the conference based on contact author. The five countries with the most accepted papers were the US (305), China (185), Great Britain (50), Germany (44), and Japan (24). As observed by the ACL2019 Program Chairs, the distribution is too skewed for a fair comparison of acceptance rates. As in their analysis, if we consider the top 15 countries in terms of number of submissions, the countries with the highest acceptance rates are Israel (40.9%), Great Britain (31.1%), United States (29.4%), Germany (29.3%), and a tie between Hong Kong and Singapore, both with 26.7%. This list is almost the same as last year, except Great Britain was not in the top five.
