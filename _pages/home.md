<h2>Welcome!</h2>

The 10th International Conference — Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts — will take place online from <b>December 16th through December 18th, 2021</b>.

The world of Data Science changes every year. At AIST, we exchange our understanding of the Science state-of-the-art, as well as how it applies to life and business. AIST is regularly held since 2012.

Because of the current COVID-19 epidemiological situation, the conference will be held both online (Moscow) and offline (Tbilisi).
