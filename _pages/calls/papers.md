## CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite you to submit a paper to AIST-2021, a scientific conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks, and Texts. The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in data science focusing on innovative applications of data mining and machine learning techniques to image processing, analysis of social networks, text processing, and other domains, such as economics or geographic information systems.

The previous conferences in 2012-2020 attracted a significant number of students, researchers, academics, and engineers working on the analysis of images, texts, and social networks. The broad scope of AIST makes it an event where researchers from different domains, exploiting various data analysis techniques, can meet and exchange ideas. The conference allows specialists from different fields to meet each other, present their work, and discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of their data analysis problems.

## Past Conferences

Similar to the previous years, the conference proceedings will be published in the Springerâ€™s in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. You can take a look at the proceedings of the last three years to get an idea about what kind of papers are accepted and what kind of topics are discussed at the conference:

## Publication

AIST-2021 proceedings will be published in Springer LNCS ([Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/series/558)). The companion volume will be published in the satellite series CCIS ([Communications in Computer and Information Science](https://www.springer.com/series/7899)).

Please pay attention to the publisher's [Editorial Policies](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/editorial-policies/14214).
 
## Venue

The conference will be held online with the support of Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) and partially offline in Tbilisi, Georgia.
 
## Submission Guidelines

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:

Full papers describing completed research up to 12 pages of content with references.
Posters describing ongoing research up to 6 pages of content with references.
The papers must be formatted according to the [Springer LNCS style](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0). LaTeX template of the Springer LNCS is [available at ShareLaTeX platform](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/journals/lecture-notes-in-computer-science-(lncs)). We encourage you to use the LaTeX template instead of the Word template. For further information please also read ["Author instructions"](http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)

Papers should be submitted through the [EasyChair conference management system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aist20211). Submitted papers should provide sufficient detail to allow the Program Committee to assess the merits of the paper on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the conference topics, originality, significance, and clarity of presentation. Papers should present original work previously not published or concurrently submitted to another conference or journal. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members. To ensure a fair assessment of the submissions, the review will be double-blind, so you need to make your paper anonymous (remove links to your personal pages, acknowledgements, affiliations, etc.).
