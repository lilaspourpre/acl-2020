## CALL FOR PAPERS

Dear colleagues,
    
We are excited to invite you to submit a paper to AIST-2023, a scientific conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks, and Texts. The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in data science focusing on innovative applications of data analysis and machine learning techniques to image processing, analysis of network data, text processing, and other domains, such as economics or geographic information systems. 
    
The conference is intended for computer scientists and practitioners whose research interests are related to data science. The ten previous editions of the AIST conference held in 2012-2021 attracted a significant number of students, researchers, academics, and engineers working on the analysis of images, texts, and social networks. The broad scope of AIST makes it an event where researchers from different domains, exploiting various data analysis techniques, can meet and exchange ideas. The conference allows specialists from different fields to meet each other, present their work, and discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of their data analysis problems. Another important aim of the conference is to stimulate scientists and people from the industry to benefit from the knowledge exchange and identify possible grounds for fruitful collaboration.
    
Similar to the previous years, the main volume of the conference proceedings will be published in the Springer’s in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
    
## Venue

The conference continues to travel in a beautiful (and tasty!) region. This year AIST will be held offline in Yerevan, Armenia. More specifically the event is organized with support of Zaven & Sonia Akian College of Science & Engineering, [American University of Armenia](https://cse.aua.am/). Besides the scientific knowledge you will enjoy a good season in Armenia and dive into local culture. The conference will feature representatives of the local data analysis community.
    
## Tracks

Submission can be made in one of the following tracks chaired by experts in the respective fields:

- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision 
- Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Submission Guidelines

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:

- Full papers describing completed research up to 12 pages of content with references.
- Posters describing ongoing research (poster PDF itself + abstract).

The papers must be formatted according to the [Springer LNCS style](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0). LaTeX template of the Springer LNCS is [available at Overleaf platform](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj). We encourage you to use the LaTeX template instead of the Word template.

Papers should be submitted through the [EasyChair conference management system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aist2023). Submitted papers should be written in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the Program Committee to assess the merits of the paper on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the conference topics, originality, significance, and clarity of presentation.

The program committee expects that authors are ready to submit high-quality research papers. We also **require at least one of the authors to attend the conference** to present their study. Papers should present original work previously not published or concurrently submitted to another conference or journal.

Each paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members. To ensure a fair assessment of the submissions, **the review will be double-blind, so you need to make your paper anonymous** (remove links to your personal pages, acknowledgments, affiliations, etc.). Your work will be rejected in case you did not anonymize properly your paper. However, ArXiv pre-prints are allowed to be submitted. 

### Poster session

You may also create a non-archival submission for poster session. It can be based on a published or unpublished work. Your abstract (and optionally the extended abstract in PDF) should be submitted by <strike>July 15</strike> <strike>July 20</strike> August 25 to the special “Poster session” track.
