<b>Graph-theoretic Methods in Computer Vision: Recent Advances</b> <br/> <br/>
<b>Abstract:</b> Graphs and graph-based representations have long been an important tool in computer vision and pattern recognition, especially because of their representational power and flexibility. There is now a renewed interest toward explicitly formulating computer vision problems as graph problems. This is particularly advantageous because it allows vision problems to be cast in a pure, abstract setting with solid theoretical underpinnings and also permits access to the full arsenal of graph algorithms developed in computer science and operations research. In this talk I’ll describe some recent developments in graph-theoretic methods which allow us to address within a unified and principled framework a number of classical computer vision problems. These include interactive image segmentation, image geo-localization, image retrieval, multi-camera tracking, and person re-identification. The concepts discussed here have intriguing connections with optimization theory, game theory and dynamical systems theory, and can be applied to weighted graphs, digraphs and hypergraphs alike.

<b>Making models fairer through explanations</b> <br/> <br/>
<b>Abstract:</b> Algorithmic decisions are now being used on a daily basis, and based on Machine Learning (ML) processes that may be complex and biased. This raises several concerns given the critical impact that biased decisions may have on individuals or on society as a whole. Moreover, unfair outcomes not only affect human rights, but they also undermine public trust in ML and AI.

In this talk we will address fairness issues of ML models based on decision outcomes. In fact, we will show how the simple idea of "feature dropout" followed by an "ensemble approach" can improve model fairness. To illustrate we will revisit the case of "LimeOut" that was proposed to tackle "process fairness", which measures a model's reliance on sensitive or discriminatory features. Given a classifier, a dataset and a set of sensitive features,  LimeOut first assesses whether the classifier is fair by checking its reliance on the sensitive features using "Lime explanations". If deemed unfair, LimeOut then applies feature dropout to obtain a pool of classifiers. These are then combined into an ensemble classifier that was empirically shown to be less dependent on sensitive features, while improving the original classifier's accuracy.

We will present further experiments on multiple datasets and several state of the art classifiers that confirm the improvements of LimeOut's classifiers  with respect to process fairness as well as on the other fairness metrics, such as individual and group fairness, equal opportunity and demographic parity, among others, without compromising accuracy. We will also discuss ongoing research and several extensions to this framework that includes the use of other explainers.
